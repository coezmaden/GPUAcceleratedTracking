Scripts reproducing the benchmarks and figures can be found under `/scripts`, the algorithms source code under `/src`. 

## How to use this repository
This code base is using the Julia Language and [DrWatson](https://juliadynamics.github.io/DrWatson.jl/stable/)
to make a reproducible scientific project named
> GPUAcceleratedTracking

It is authored by Can Ã–zmaden.

To (locally) reproduce this project, do the following:

0. Download this code base. Notice that raw data are typically not included in the
   git-history and may need to be downloaded independently.
1. Open a Julia console and do:
   ```
   julia> using Pkg
   julia> Pkg.add("DrWatson") # install globally, for using `quickactivate`
   julia> Pkg.activate("path/to/this/project")
   julia> Pkg.instantiate()
   ```

This will install all necessary packages for you to be able to run the scripts and
everything should work out of the box, including correctly finding local paths.

Please contact the author can.oezmaden(at)rwth-aachen.de for the raw data attained during the experiments.
