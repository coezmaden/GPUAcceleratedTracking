  abstract = {Adaptive antenna array processing is widely known to provide significant anti-interference capabilities within a Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receiver. A main challenge in the quest for such receiver architecture has always been the computational/processing requirements. Even more demanding would be to try and incorporate the flexibility of the Software-Defined Radio (SDR) design philosophy in such an implementation. This paper documents a feasible approach to a real-time SDR implementation of a beam-steered GNSS receiver and validates its performance. This research implements a real-time software receiver on a widely-available x86-based multi-core microprocessor to process four-element antenna array data streams sampled with 16-bit resolution. The software receiver is capable of 12 channels all-in-view Controlled Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA) array processing capable of rejecting multiple interferers. Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instructions assembly coding and multithreaded programming, the key to such an implementation to reduce computational complexity, are fully documented within the paper. In conventional antenna array systems, receivers use the geometry of antennas and cable lengths known in advance. The documented CRPA implementation is architected to operate without extensive set-up and pre-calibration and leverages Space-Time Adaptive Processing (STAP) to provide adaptation in both the frequency and space domains. The validation component of the paper demonstrates that the developed software receiver operates in real time with live Global Positioning System (GPS) and Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) L1 C/A code signal. Further, interference rejection capabilities of the implementation are also demonstrated using multiple synthetic interferers which are added to the live data stream.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT The GNSS environment is experiencing two major changes: the introduction of a new civil signal in the L5 band and the launch of new GNSS constellations. These improvements could enable worldwide vertical guidance using Advanced Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (ARAIM). Before ARAIM can be implemented, it will be necessary to develop a common understanding across service providers of the navigation requirements, the threat model, the airborne algorithm, and the role of ground monitoring. We outline a concept for the provision of integrity based on ARAIM. First, an interpretation of vertical guidance (LPV-200) requirements is proposed. Then, we describe a comprehensive threat model for GNSS which includes both nominal performance and faulted behavior. We will show how the threats could be mitigated through the use of ground monitoring and the Integrity Support Message in addition to the ARAIM airborne algorithm. Finally, examples of constellation configurations providing worldwide coverage of LPV-200 are presented. Copyright © 2013 Institute of Navigation.},
